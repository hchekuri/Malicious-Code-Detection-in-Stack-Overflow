# Malicious-Code-Detection-in-Stack-Overflow
Stack overflow as one of the most important information sources for researchers and developers rely on. The stack overflow provides ready- to- use copy and paste codes snippets, which provides huge benefits for researchers and software developers in studying their behavior. The impact of this behavior on code security is unknown. Due to complex nature of code security, it is very difficult to provide secure solutions without knowing the type of malware in the code. Malicious executable programs in stack overflow are designed to damage userâ€™s systems without their consent. It is very important to find the malicious codes-snippets in such online programming platform. In this report, we tried to identify the malware from the data of code snippets present in stack overflow. We evaluated based on the collected data set using ten-fold cross validations and comparisons with SVM and decision tree.

Process:

Step-1.) Run the code code_extractor.py to convert body of each post to a new file in CodeSnippets/ directory.
Step-2.) Run the code vt.py to label the data which is extracted from the Step-1. It also helps in uploading the data and then fetching the report. 
Step-3.) Run the code feature_extractor.py to extract all the features from the posts.
Step-4.) Run the code svm_classifier.py to get the cross validation accuracies and the plots of features and if it is malicious or not.
